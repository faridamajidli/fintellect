# Fintellect: AI-Powered Financial Planning for Students
## Overview
Fintellect is an AI-driven financial advisory platform tailored for students in American universities. It combines large language models, financial behavior clustering, and peer benchmarking to deliver personalized, adaptive, and actionable financial plans. The project was developed as part of a data analytics bachelor's thesis exploring how intelligent systems can improve student financial well-being.

* AI-Generated Financial Plans: Leverages Hugging Faceâ€™s Zephyr-7B model via Inference API for personalized advice.
* Peer Benchmarking: Compares student budgets and expenses to city/university averages.
* Interactive Dashboards: Visualizes income, savings, and spending behavior using Plotly.
* Financial Literacy Tools: Includes videos, simulators, and calculators for education and engagement.
